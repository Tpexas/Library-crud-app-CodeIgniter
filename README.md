# Library CRUD
This was one of the first tasks in University to create basic CRUD web app. I chose to do small library management system. MySQL database is made of 4 tables, of which user, author and book tables have fully functioning CRUD operations (books can only be added through authors page), order table has return function, which once executed writes return date and state to the database.
